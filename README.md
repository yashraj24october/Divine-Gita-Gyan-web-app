Purpose of developing Sri Bhagavad Gita web app is to make the entire divine knowledge of "Srimad bhagavad Gita" accessible to every human being in less time and easily.

### <b>Srimad Bhagavad Gita</b> is the Divine Discourse spoken by supreme lord sri Krishna himself.
- Each Chapter and verse of "Srimad bhagavad gita" is the Ultimate guide for successful life and humanity.
